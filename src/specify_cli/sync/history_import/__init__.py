"""Historical-import pipeline for ``spec-kitty sync import-history`` (#2262).

A first sync registers a remote project/build but leaves it with zero
materialized missions — the SaaS materializer refuses to fabricate a
WorkPackage from a status event with no prior create. This package emits the
missing ``MissionCreated → WPCreated[] → WPStatusChanged[]`` prefix so
historical local work populates the projection.

Stages (see issue #2262 §3.3):

* WP-Y2 — :mod:`.scan`: the hybrid SCAN — read the on-disk lifecycle prefix
  where present, synthesize it from ``meta.json`` + ``tasks/WP*.md`` where
  absent, and drop local-only lifecycle events.
* WP-Y3 — :mod:`.synthesize`: turn a :class:`MissionScan` into the ordered,
  deterministic ``MissionCreated → WPCreated[] → WPStatusChanged[]`` envelope
  stream (INV-3 / INV-4).
* WP-Y4 — :mod:`.identity`: resolve the ``(project_uuid, project_slug,
  repo_slug)`` trio — real persisted UUID on ``--apply`` (INV-5), synthetic
  offline UUID for dry-run, never persisting on the read path (INV-2).

Later slices add PROVENANCE, PREFLIGHT, UPLOAD, and REPORT.
